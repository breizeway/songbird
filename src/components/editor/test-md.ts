## [Verse 1]
You ${"`"}might${"`"} lose your faith in science
You *might* lose faith in wealth
**You** might **lose** your faith in Jesus
Or, or ~~lose~~ faith in yourself

## [Chorus]
But when I let you down
Look past your doubt
Just, please, please, please
Don't lose your faith in me

## [Verse 2]
You could lose your faith in music
Or lose your faith in friends
You could lose your faith in freedom
Feel trapped in your own skin
Oh, but I'll be right there beside you
(I'll be right there beside you)
Oh, when the walls are caving in
(I swear, oh, I'm not going anywhere)

## [Chorus]
But when I let you down
Look past your doubt
Just please, please, please
Don't lose your faith in me
Please don't lose your faith in me

<br />

## [Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
I'm not going anywhere
Oh, oh, oh
I'm not going anywhere
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
I'm not going anywhere

## [Chorus]
But when I let you down
Look past your doubt
Just please, please, please
Don't lose your faith in me
Please don't lose your faith in me
I'm not going anywhere`;
