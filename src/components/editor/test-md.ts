## [Verse 1]
|D|You might lose your faith in |F#m|science
|Bm|You *might* lose faith in |A|wealth
|D|**You** might **lose** your faith in |F#m|Jesus
|Bm|Or, or ~~lose~~ faith in your|A|self

## [Chorus]
But when I |D/F|let you |G|down
|D|Look past your |A|doubt
Just, |D/F|please, |G|please, |D|please
Don't |A|lose your faith in |D|me

## [Verse 2]
|D|You could lose your faith in |F#m|music
|Bm|Or lose your faith in |A|friends
|D|You could lose your faith in |F#m|freedom
|Bm|Feel trapped in your own |A|skin
Oh, but I'll be right there beside you
(I'll be right there beside you)
Oh, when the walls are caving in
(I swear, oh, I'm not going anywhere)

## [Chorus]
But when I let you down
Look past your doubt
Just please, please, please
Don't lose your faith in me
Please don't lose your faith in me

## [Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
I'm not going anywhere
Oh, oh, oh
I'm not going anywhere
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
I'm not going anywhere

## [Chorus]
But when I let you down
Look past your doubt
Just please, please, please
Don't lose your faith in me
Please don't lose your faith in me
I'm not going anywhere`;
