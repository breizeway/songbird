export const testMd = `[Verse 1]

You might lose your faith in science

You might lose faith in wealth

You might lose your faith in Jesus

Or, or lose faith in yourself

<br />

[Chorus]

But when I let you down

Look past your doubt

Just, please, please, please

Don't lose your faith in me

<br />

[Verse 2]

You could lose your faith in music

Or lose your faith in friends

You could lose your faith in freedom

Feel trapped in your own skin

Oh, but I'll be right there beside you

(I'll be right there beside you)

Oh, when the walls are caving in

(I swear, oh, I'm not going anywhere)

<br />

[Chorus]

But when I let you down

Look past your doubt

Just please, please, please

Don't lose your faith in me

Please don't lose your faith in me

<br />

[Bridge]

Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh

I'm not going anywhere

Oh, oh, oh

I'm not going anywhere

Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh

I'm not going anywhere

<br />

[Chorus]

But when I let you down

Look past your doubt

Just please, please, please

Don't lose your faith in me

Please don't lose your faith in me

I'm not going anywhere`;
