  `# Colour - Group Love
## [Verse 1]
|F#| I am a man, man, man, man |A#m|up, up in the air
And I |F#|run around, 'round, 'round, 'round this town, town
And |A#m|act like I don't care
|F#| So when you see me flying |A#m|by the planet's moon
You don't |F#|need to explain if everything's changed
Just |A|know I'm just like you

## [Bridge]
|F#|Huh, |A#m|ha
|F#|Huh, |A#m|ha
|F#|Huh, |A#m|ha
|F#|Huh, |A#m|ha

## [Verse 2]
|F#| So I pull the switch, the switch, the |A#m|switch inside my head
And I see... 
|F#|black, black, green, and brown 
brown, brown, brown and blue, 
|AF#|yellow violets, red
|F#| And suddenly a light a|A#m|ppears inside my brain
And I |F#|think of my ways, I think of my days
And |A#m|know that I have changed

## [Chorus]
|F#| It's the colors you ha-|A#m|ave
No need to be sa-|F#|ad
It really ain't tha-|A#m|at bad
|F#| It's the colors you ha-|A#m|ave
No need to be sa-|F#|ad
You've still got your ha-|A#m|ands

## [Verse 3]
|F#| So mistress, mistress, have you |A#m|been up to the roof?
He |F#|shot himself, self, there's blood on the wall
'Cause he |A#m|couldn't face the truth
|F#| Oh, knock that down, leave the |A#m|ground and find some space
And |F#|tell your friends, friends, you'll be |A#m|back again-gain
Be|F#|fore it's too late

## [Chorus]
|F#| It's the colors you ha-|A#m|ave
No need to be sa-|F#|ad
It really ain't tha-|A#m|at bad`,

## [Verse 1]
The |E|faster we're falling
We're |A|stopping and stalling
We're |E|running in circles a|A|gain
Just as |E|things were looking up
You said it |A|wasn't good enough

|E|Maybe we're just trying too |A|hard
When really it's |E|closer than it is too |A|far
 
## [Chorus 1]
Cause I'm |E|in too |A|deep
And I'm |E|trying to |A|keep
Up a|E|bove in my |A|head
In|E|stead of going |A|under
<br/>
Cause I'm |E|in too |A|deep
And I'm |E|trying to |A|keep
Up |E|above in my |A|head
In|E|stead of going |D|under
In|A|stead of going under

I'm |G#m|with you |A|I loose my mind
Be|G#m|cause I'm |E|bending
over backwards |G#m A G#m A|to relate
It's |E|one thing to complain
But |G#m|when you're |A|driving me insane
Well |G#m|then I |E|think it's
time we took |G#m A G#m A|a break

<br />

|E|There was a time when my |F#m|world was filled with
|C#m|Darkness, darkness, darkness
|E|Then I stopped dreaming, now I'm |F#m|supposed to fill it up
With |C#m|something, something, something
|E|In your eyes, I see the |F#m|eyes of somebody I knew be|C#m|fore
Long, long, long ago
|E|But I'm still trying to make my |F#m|mind up
Am I |C#m|free or am I tied up?

## [Chorus]
|E|I change shapes just to |F#m|hide in this place
But I'm |C#m|still, I'm still an animal
|E|Nobody knows it but |F#m|me when I slip
Yeah, I |C#m|slip, I'm still an animal

<br />

|E|There is a hole and I |F#m|tried to fill up with
|C#m|Money, money, money
|E|But it gets bigger 'til your |F#m|hopes is always
|C#m|Running, running, running
|E|In your eyes, I see the |F#m|eyes of somebody who |C#m|could be strong
Tell me if I'm wrong
|E|And now I'm pulling your dis|F#m|guise up
|C#m|Are you free or are you tied up?

## [Chorus] (x2)
