  `# In Too Deep- Sum 41
## [Intro]
|E A|----x2
 
## [Verse 1]
The |E|faster we're falling
We're |A|stopping and stalling
We're |E|running in circles a|A|gain
Just as |E|things were looking up
You said it |A|wasn't good enough
But |E|still we're trying one more |A|time
 
## [Refrain]
|E|Maybe we're just trying too |A|hard
When really it's |E|closer than it is too |A|far
 
## [Chorus 1]
Cause I'm |E|in too |A|deep
And I'm |E|trying to |A|keep
Up a|E|bove in my |A|head
In|E|stead of going |A|under
<br/>
Cause I'm |E|in too |A|deep
And I'm |E|trying to |A|keep
Up |E|above in my |A|head
In|E|stead of going |D|under
In|A|stead of going under
 
## [Interlude]
|E A G#m A|-----------x3
|E A G#m F#m G#m|------------------

## [Verse 2]
|E|Seems like each time
I'm |G#m|with you |A|I loose my mind
Be|G#m|cause I'm |E|bending
over backwards |G#m A G#m A|to relate
It's |E|one thing to complain
But |G#m|when you're |A|driving me insane
Well |G#m|then I |E|think it's
time we took |G#m A G#m A|a break

## [Refrain]
|E|Maybe we're just trying too |A|hard
When really it's |E|closer than it is too |A|far

## [Chorus 2]
Cause I'm |E|in too |A|deep
And I'm |E|trying to |A|keep
Up a|E|bove in my |A|head
In|E|stead of going |A|under
<br/>
Cause I'm |E|in too |A|deep
And I'm |E|trying to |A|keep
Up |E|above in my |A|head
In|E|stead of going |D|under
In|A|stead of going under
In|E|stead of going |D|under
In|A|stead of going under

## [Interlude]

## [Solo]
|E F#m D A|-----------x2

## [Verse 3]
|E| I |F#m|can't sit |A|back and |B|wonder why
|E| It |F#m|took so |A|long for |B|this to die
|E| And I |F#m|hate it |A| when you |B|fake it
|E| You can't |F#m|hide it you |A|might as well em|B|brace it
|E| So be|F#m|lieve me |A| it's not |B|easy
|E| It |F#m|seems that |A(hold)|something's telling me

## [Chorus 3]
I'm |E|in too |A|deep
|G#m|And |A|I'm |A|trying to |A|keep
|G#m|Up  |A|a-|E|bove in my |A|head|G#m|
|A|In|E|stead of going going |A|under
Cause I'm |E|in too |A|deep
|G#m|And |A|I'm |E|trying to |A|keep
|G#m|Up  |A|a-|E|bove in my |A|head|G#m|
|A|In|E|stead of going going |A|under
In|A|stead of going under|E D|
In|A|stead of going |C|under a|E D|gain
In|A|stead of going under
In|E|stead of going |D|under a|A|gain|C|
In|E|stead of going |D|under a|A|gain|C|
